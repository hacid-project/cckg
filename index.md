The Climate Change Knowledge Graph is a public knowledge base containing information about climate change data, as climate models, variables, scenarios,simulations and their relationships.

It is accessible through standard semantic APIs: a SPARQL endpoint allowing to query the underlying data, linked data access to navigate the graph resources one at a time, and dumps of all the knowledge graph for off-line usage.

The resource has been produced and is maintained in the context of the European project [Hybrid Human Artificial Collective Intelligence
in Open-Ended Domains (HACID)](https://www.hacid-project.eu/)
