The Climate Change Knowledge Graph includes and integrates data from multiple heterogeneous sources.

It currently includes the following data.

### Climate variables/metrics

- standard variables defined the [CF Metadata Conventions](https://cfconventions.org/);
- MIP variables defined in the [CMOR Tables](https://github.com/PCMDI/cmip6-cmor-tables) (they are aggregations/specializations of the CF variables);
- indices defined in [Climdex](https://www.climdex.org/), which are an extension of the [ETCCDI Climate Change Indices](https://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/list_27_indices.shtml).

### Climate models/simulations/datasets

- metadata from the main [CMIP5](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/) experiments (historic and RCPs);
- metadata from the [CORDEX](https://cordex.org/) regional experiments.
