# Data Model

To favour interoperability, the knowledge graph is represented using semantic web standards, specifically using RDF a base data model and a network of ontologies to define and formalize the adopted schema.

The following ontologies are used in the graph:
- [HACID top-level ontology](https://w3id.org/hacid/onto/top-level), containing broad terms used throughout the [HACID project](https://www.hacid-project.eu/) and based mostly on the upper ontology [DOLCE-Ultralite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_ontology#DOLCE);
- [Core Climate Services Ontology (CCSO)](https://w3id.org/hacid/onto/ccso), containing terms that are specific to the climate domain;
- [HACID data ontology module](https://w3id.org/hacid/onto/data), containing a semantically rich representation of datasets, variables, dimensional spaces.
